    <p class="song-lyrics"> 
        Little Bunny Foo Foo<br>
        Hopping through the forest,<br>
        Scooping up the field mice<br>
        And bopping them on the head.<br>
    </p>

    <p class="song-lyrics">
    And down, down, down came the Good Fairy, and said:<br>
    "Little Bunny Foo Foo<br>
    I don’t want to see you<br>
    Scooping up the field mice<br>
    And bopping them on the head<br>
